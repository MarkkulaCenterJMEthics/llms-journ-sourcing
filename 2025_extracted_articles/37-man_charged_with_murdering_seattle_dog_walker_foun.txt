SEATTLE — A man charged with murdering an 80-year-old woman who was working as a dog walker last summer has been found incompetent to proceed to trial for a second time.
The incompetency determination comes three months after a finding from December when Jahmed Haynes, 48, was determined to be competent after receiving treatment at the Western State Hospital in Pierce County.
Haynes is charged with first-degree murder, assault, and animal cruelty for the August 2024 deaths of Ruth Dalton and her dog, "Prince."
I'm mad about having to go round and round," said Melanie Roberts, Ruth Dalton's granddaughter. "We are no better off than in September, the first time they got him to appear in court. I think the system is broken. I think he’s competent. I think he’s always been competent.

At a hearing on Thursday, there was a brief discussion about whether Haynes would be ordered to take his medication while in custody. Judge Averil Rothrock said that any order to forcibly give him mediation as part of treatment would have to be resolved at a later hearing.
If he chooses not to medicate himself, he is making a choice not to be competent and not to be compliant,” Roberts said. “Somebody in this court system needs to put their foot down and make him take his meds.

According to the charges, Haynes carjacked Dalton while she was parked along Martin Luther King Jr. Way East in the Madison Valley neighborhood. Dalton had just picked up several dogs as part of her dog-walking business "Grandma's Critter Care."
Haynes forced Dalton out of the vehicle and then ran her over, killing her, according to police.
Several dogs jumped out of the car during the chaos and were later found in the surrounding area. Investigators say Haynes took Dalton's dog, Prince, and stabbed him to death before leaving his body in a trash can in south Seattle.
Haynes was arrested the next day after police said they found his fingerprints in Dalton's car, which was abandoned at the park where Prince's body was discarded. According to the charges, Haynes had Dalton's car keys on him at the time of arrest, along with a knife that had blood and animal hair on it.
The incompetency ruling will move Haynes from the King County Jail back to the Western State Hospital for a 90-day treatment period at which time he will be reassessed.
"He goes to Western, they medicate him, and he’s competent. He goes to jail, he refuses meds, and he’s not competent. I’m tired of the merry-go-round," said Roberts. "The state is broken. They are all about comforting a criminal and to hell with the victim.”
