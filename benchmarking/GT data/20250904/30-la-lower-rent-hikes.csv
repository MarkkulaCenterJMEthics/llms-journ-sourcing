1, The council approved that motion and called for a study to “conclude within 3 months.”,Named Organization,,L.A. City Council,,
2,"The independent analysis found some of the city’s rules governing rent increases have favored landlords over tenants. The report recommends changes that could lower the rent hikes tenants face each year, setting up what is sure to be a fierce debate at city hall.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,"Four months later, the city still has not released it publicly. LAist obtained the report through a public records request."
3,"Over the course of 193 pages, the report offers an extensive analysis of the L.A. rental housing market, challenges facing both tenants and landlords, and the impact of the city’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
4,"About 35% of the rent L.A. tenants pay goes to operating expenses for apartment buildings, on average. This includes maintenance, utilities, insurance, payroll and other routine costs. Landlords can use the remainder to cover mortgages and turn a profit.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
5,"From January 2020 through January 2023, 4 in 10 rent-controlled L.A. apartments became vacant. When a tenant leaves a rent-controlled unit, the city’s rules allow landlords to raise rents to market rates. These higher rents helped landlords absorb the impact of a nearly four-year freeze on rent hikes.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
6,"Many expenses have risen sharply for landlords in recent years, outpacing inflation. Property insurance costs have roughly doubled since 2020. However, the report notes these expenses make up a relatively small portion of overall costs.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
7,"About one-fifth of L.A. renters are living below the federal poverty line. According to U.S. Census data, just over half of those renters spend 90% of their income or more on rent. Rent increases can leave these low-income renters vulnerable to displacement and homelessness.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
8,The city’s current range of allowable annual rent increases — anywhere from 3% to 8% depending on inflation — is higher than the increases permitted in most other California cities with rent control.,Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
9,"Either eliminate a provision allowing landlords to raise rents an extra 1% per year if they pay for a tenant’s gas, plus another 1% if they pay for electricity — or replace it. The report estimates each 1% increase could raise rents an additional $150 to $240 per month after 10 years, more than the actual cost of providing those utilities. One option, the report says, would be to instead use a surcharge that better captures the increased costs of providing those utilities.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
10,"The report recommends considering changing which version of the consumer price index is used to calculate allowable increased to one that excludes housing costs, shown as ""Less Shelter"" in the chart above.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
11,"Change how annual rent increases are calculated. Instead of using a version of the consumer price index driven to a large degree by housing cost inflation, the report recommends a different index that excludes housing costs. The report argues this would stop the feedback loop of allowing high housing inflation to create further housing inflation.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
12,"Daniel Yukelson with the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles pointed to recent data from the National Apartment Association, a trade group for property owners, concluding that California landlords earn 7 cents of profit on average for every dollar of rent.",Named Person,,Daniel Yukelson ,,Daniel Yukelson with the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.
13,"“What [the report] is trying to do is make a PR effort to lay the groundwork to chip away at what little ability landlords have in L.A. to be able to raise rents and be able to keep up with their costs,” Yukelson said.",Named Person,,Daniel Yukelson ,,Daniel Yukelson with the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.
14,"He said the report takes a macroeconomic view of the city’s rental market, but fails to capture the unique struggles facing many small landlords.",Named Person,,Daniel Yukelson ,,Daniel Yukelson with the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.
15,"“There are plenty of owners out there who have had their renters in place for many years,” Yukelson said. “They're way below market. And they're having trouble today keeping up with the growing costs of insurance, maintenance and supplies.”",Named Person,,Daniel Yukelson ,,Daniel Yukelson with the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.
16,Tenant advocates took a very different view of the report. They said it correctly identifies problems with L.A. rent control and validates their demands for stronger limits.,Unamed group of people,,Tenant advocates,,
17,"“Small landlords are able to maintain their profits and draw income above their expenses — they haven't been overly burdened by rent stabilization,” said Christina Boyar, a legal fellow with Public Counsel and a member of the Keep L.A. Housed coalition.",Named Person,,"Christina Boyar, legal fellow, Public Counsel",,and a member of the Keep L.A. Housed coalition.
18,Tenant advocates have called for a 3% ceiling on annual rent hikes and elimination of the 2% surcharge for landlords who provide gas and electricity. They point to other L.A.-area cities that currently limit rent increases to less than 3% with no add-ons for utilities.,Unamed group of people,,Tenant advocates,,
19,"“The report shows that rent costs exceeding what tenants can pay is a primary cause of homelessness,” Boyar said. “We are obviously in a homelessness crisis in L.A., and if this formula isn't updated soon, more folks will just fall into homelessness.”",Named Person,,"Christina Boyar, legal fellow, Public Counsel",,
20,"When LAist first requested the report, officials told a reporter the study was not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, saying there was an exemption for “deliberative process.”",Unamed group of people,,city's housing officials,,The city’s housing officials have been in possession of the Economic Roundtable report since May.
21,"Daniel Flaming, president of the Economic Roundtable and a co-author of the report, said he didn’t have a good answer for why the report was kept under wraps.",Named Person,,"Daniel Flaming, president, the Economic Roundtable",,and a co-author of the report
22,"“I think when it's a politically contentious issue, there are attempts to manage the conversation,” Flaming said. “The substance of the report is final. It was submitted as a final report and accepted by the city as a final work product.”",Named Person,,"Daniel Flaming, president, the Economic Roundtable",,
23,"Sharon Sandow, a spokesperson for the L.A. Housing Department, told LAist last week the document was still a “draft report,” and they didn't have a specific date lined up for its release.",Named Person,,"Sharon Sandow, spokesperson, L.A. Housing Department",,
24,"“There are several rounds of revisions left to go before this report is considered final,” Sandow said in an email. “Economic Roundtable is under contract to complete this report through January 2025 — though clearly we hope to have it finalized before then.”",Named Person,,"Sharon Sandow, spokesperson, L.A. Housing Department",,said in an email

26,LAist noted in its correspondence with housing department officials that the report was not a draft but was a finished product submitted by the contractor.,Named Organization,,Laist,,"Under state public records law, preliminary drafts must be released if they are retained in the ordinary course of business, as this one has been."
27,"The report notes that because L.A. has a 3% floor on annual increases — even in years when the consumer price index is lower — landlords have often been allowed to raise rents above inflation. Between 2010 and 2020, the consumer price index in L.A. rose 21%. During the same period, rents in rent-controlled L.A. apartments were allowed to rise 36%.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
28,"On the other hand, the report finds that landlords have faced unique challenges — particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
29,The report also notes that high turnover helped landlords raise rents to market rates and keep rental income nearly at pace with inflation.,Document,,Economic Roundtable,,
30,But landlord advocates say some property owners have yet to fully recover from the pandemic. They now worry about the potential cost of proposals to remove gas stoves and install air conditioners.,Unamed group of people,,Landlord advocates,,
31,"“The cost of electricity is just going to continue going up,” Yukelson with the Apartment Association said. If the city stops landlords who provide electricity from raising rents an additional 1% per year, he said, “The next tenant is going to have to pay that burden, because the rents are going to have to go up.”",Named Person,,Daniel Yukelson ,,Daniel Yukelson with the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.
32,"On balance, Flaming said the report shows that L.A.’s policies diverge significantly from how other California cities handle rent control. He said the utility surcharge in particular seems “arbitrary.”",Named Person,,"Daniel Flaming, president, the Economic Roundtable",,
33,"“The Los Angeles ceiling and floor are atypically high for rent-controlled cities,” he said. “Among cities that have elected to control rents — and not all cities have — Los Angeles appears to be tilted toward landlords.”",Named Person,,"Daniel Flaming, president, the Economic Roundtable",,
34,"Some L.A. city council members have floated the idea of establishing different rent control rules for “mom and pop” landlords and larger, corporate landlords.",Unamed group of people,,L.A. City Council members,,

36,"Soto-Martinez, one of the council members who requested the report be commissioned — has already called for capping increases at 3%.",Named Person,,Soto-Martinez,City Council Member,
37,"In an email reacting to the Economic Roundtable report, Soto-Martínez told LAist, “As we await the finalized version of this report, it’s heartening to see so much data supporting the policy changes that renters have been demanding — especially when it comes to preventing excessive rent increases that can devastate working families.”",Named Person,,Soto-Martinez,City Council Member,In an email reacting to the Economic Roundtable report
