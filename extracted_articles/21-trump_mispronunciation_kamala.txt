OPINION (CBM) – Mispronouncing Kamala Harris’s first name isn’t just a harmless mistake; it’s a reflection of a deeper issue that goes beyond simply placing emphasis on the wrong syllable.
Leadership is about showing respect, paying attention to detail, and engaging thoughtfully with the diverse communities that make up our country. When leaders fail in these areas, it raises questions about their judgement and ability to lead.
Harris, as the first female Vice President of the United States, carries a first name that is rooted in her Indian cultural heritage passed down from her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. Her name means “lotus flower,” and is pronounced “Comma-la.” So, when so-called leaders can’t be bothered to say her name correctly, it signals a disregard for the significance of that heritage, as well as a lack of commitment to understanding and representing all Americans. This neglect undermines the very essence of leadership, which is to respect and represent the people.
This issue of mispronouncing her name is not an isolated one. During the 2024 Republican National Convention, nearly half of the speakers who mentioned Harris’s first name mispronounced it. Former President Donald Trump, tech mogul Elon Musk, and several Republican leaders, including members of Congress and governors, repeatedly mispronounce her name. Bob Unanue, CEO of Goya Foods, even mocked her name by calling her ‘Que-mala,’ which means ‘so bad’” in Spanish.
When influential people set this kind of example, it sends the wrong message—that details and respect for diversity don’t matter.
If Harris’s political opponents can’t take the time or make the effort to learn the correct pronunciation of her first name, it raises doubts about their ability to tackle more intricate and critical issues that demand attention to detail, empathy, and cultural awareness. In a nation as diverse as the United States, repeatedly mispronouncing the name of one of its highest-ranking officials undermines the core values of inclusivity and respect that are foundational to effective governance.
Mispronouncing a person’s name is often an attempt to characterize them as an outsider or “other,” a tactic that Trump frequently uses to diminish the individual’s identity and create a sense of alienation. This behavior goes beyond disrespect; it is calculated to deepen divisions and foster an “us versus them” mentality.
By refusing to correctly say a person’s name, Trump and others are showing a lack of respect for cultural differences, reinforcing the perception that they are arrogant, dismissive, and disconnected from the diverse society they aim to lead. Ironically, these actions make them appear to be ‘weird’ themselves.
Trump’s repeated mispronunciation of Harris’s name reflects a growing sense of desperation. As his poll numbers drop, his reliance on disrespectful tactics like this highlights an inability to focus on substantive issues. Instead of engaging with the real concerns of the American people, Trump’s behavior deviates from meaningful dialogue, revealing poor judgment that is unbefitting of a presidential candidate.
Since becoming a candidate for President, Harris has refrained from responding directly to Trump and others who mispronounce her name. However, during a 2020 interview with Trevor Noah on The Daily Show, she addressed the issue with grace and insight. Harris explained that a name is a precious gift from one’s family, rooted in tradition, love, and hope. She emphasized that respecting the significance of names honors those values, while mocking or mispronouncing them is childish and reflects a lack of maturity and respect.
“That the highest elected leaders should conduct themselves like they did when they were children on the playground, it speaks poorly of their appreciation for the responsibility of the role that they have,” Harris said to Noah. “And I think it’s a reflection of their values and their maturity.”
Harris added, “I don’t pay attention to the name-calling, Trevor. There’s some of us who have lived a lifetime of being called names. It is predictable, it is childish, and it will not distract me.”
Her response underscores the importance of respecting the cultural significance behind names, especially for those in leadership positions. By addressing the topic this way, Harris highlighted her commitment to dignity and respect, even in the face of those who choose to behave otherwise.
In the end, it’s not just about a name — it’s about what that name stands for and the respect it deserves. A true leader understands the importance of every detail, every nuance, and every person they serve. Anything less falls short of the standard of leadership that the American people deserve.
