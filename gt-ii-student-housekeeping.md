# GT Expansion (Summer 2026) Student Housekeeping List

Running list of items for the student annotators to resolve. Not part of
`development-of-v59.md` (that's the internal migration/schema punchlist) —
this is action items to hand to the students directly, starting with the
2026-09-11 meeting.

1. **Missing double-annotation for stories 60, 74, 98.** The GT Expansion List
   marks all three as dual-annotated (both AV and SZ columns populated), but
   only one annotator's file has actually been delivered for each so far.
   Need the second annotator's file for all three.
2. **21 stories have no URL anywhere in the Expansion List** (headline text
   present, but no hyperlink attached on either side): 53, 61, 65, 66, 91,
   95, 96, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 110, 111, 123, 124, 135, 136.
   Need either the URL added to the sheet, or the PDF supplied directly —
   can't pull story text without one or the other.
3. **Stories 67 and 70 are the same underlying article** ("California Asks
   Ships to Hit the Brakes for Whales," KQED) — AV annotated it as story 67
   (Table II, 10 rows), SZ annotated it as story 70 (Table I, 11 rows), but
   they were never paired under one shared story number the way the other
   double-coded stories were (52/55, 76/94, etc.). Needs a decision: merge
   under one number, or confirm they should stay separate and explain why.
   - **AV's story 67 annotation file was never delivered.** The Expansion
     List records AV_ss = 10 for story 67, but no XLSx for it exists in the
     downloaded finished-files folder — only SZ's story 70 copy has actually
     been received. Need AV's file for story 67.
   - **Orphaned blank placeholder row for story 67.** Table I, row 20 of the
     Expansion List has StoryNumber = 67 but both AV and SZ headline/count
     columns blank on that row — no data either side, just a leftover
     placeholder. Should be cleaned up/removed once the 67/70 merge decision
     above is settled.
4. **Story 167's URL looks like a copy-paste error.** Its headline is "Life
   under a Delhi flyover: how one homeless family endures the city's extreme
   heat," but the hyperlink attached to it points to the Austin Chronicle's
   "The Vicious Cycle of Homeless Camp Sweeps" — the same URL as story 166.
   Needs the correct URL for story 167.
5. **33 of the 81 story URLs fetched failed or returned unusable content**
   (mostly NYT/Reuters/WaPo/AP/Politico paywalls or bot-blocking, a few
   empty/too-short extractions from MSN/Medium/YouTube/etc.) — full list
   below. These need PDFs.
   - fetch failed: 50, 54, 57, 58, 60, 62, 68, 69, 71, 73, 84, 98, 114, 128,
     129, 130, 150, 151, 153, 157, 158, 162, 165, 169, 181
   - extraction empty/too short (URL loaded but no usable article text):
     72, 80, 100, 127, 172, 175
   - **false success caught during review, actually paywalled — needs a PDF
     too:** 82 (its URL in the sheet was a Google redirect wrapper; the
     unwrapped NYT URL also fails to fetch, same as the other NYT stories
     above), 161 (Washington Examiner — two paragraphs then a subscription
     prompt, not the full article).
   - **Net result: 48 stories successfully pulled into
     `extracted_articles_boilerplate/` with real full-text content.**
6. *(open — add items here as they surface during the GT-II migration prep)*

## status-2026-09-14

Full cross-reference of everything delivered so far (`~/Documents/GT-II-finishedfiles-XLSx/`), run before the next batch of XLSx files comes down.

**a) All XLSx → CSV conversion: ✅ Complete.**
80 XLSx files in the folder, minus 2 deliberately excluded (133, 134 — confirmed different experiment) = 78. All 78 have a corresponding CSV in `benchmarking/GT data/GT-II/`, 1:1, zero missing, zero count mismatches.

**b) No-URL stories itemized in housekeeping list: ✅ Confirmed.**
Of the 71 distinct story numbers with an XLSx delivered, 19 fall in the no-URL bucket (53, 61, 65, 66, 91, 95, 101–107, 110, 111, 123, 124, 135, 136) — all already itemized in item 2 above. (Story 96 is also on that no-URL list but has no XLSx delivered yet, so it's a non-issue for this batch.)

**c) Dual-coded files converted: ✅ Confirmed.**
9 story numbers have 2 XLSx files each (52, 55, 76, 94, 108, 109, 112, 122, 125) — all 9 have exactly 2 corresponding CSVs. All 9 also have real article text and were fully carried through Phase 1/2 of the migration.

**d) Maximum possible migration complete: ✅ Confirmed.**
Full accounting of all 71 distinct story numbers:

| Bucket | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Successfully pulled (real article text) | 30 numbers → 39 files (incl. 9 dual-coded pairs) | Phase 0 **and** Phase 1/2 complete |
| Fetch failed | 15 | Phase 0 done, blocked on text (item 5 above) |
| Extraction empty/too short | 4 | Phase 0 done, blocked on text (item 5 above) |
| False success (paywall/redirect) | 1 (82) | Phase 0 done, blocked on text (item 5 above) |
| No URL at all | 19 | Phase 0 done, blocked on text (item 2 above) |
| Deliberately excluded | 2 (133, 134) | Not migrated, confirmed different experiment |
| **Total** | **71** | fully accounted for |

Every structural conversion that could be done is done; every deeper annotation-quality pass (Phase 1/2) that could be run against real article text has been run, against exactly the 39 files that have it — no story with real text was missed, and nothing without real text was silently skipped without being logged.
