"About nine months ago, the two men agreed he could withhold rent until repairs were made, he said. In the meantime, he started looking for a new place to live. But, his landlord's unwillingness to cooperate with rental history checks by property management firms made finding a new home for his family of five extremely difficult.",Named Person,Bryant Woods,null,"One day last fall, Bryant Woods' rotted-out flooring opened up beneath his 11-year-old daughter. Major leaks in the rental home had allowed mold to thrive and rot to set in. In the winters, he was forced to use space heaters or his electric oven to stay warm since the heat didn't work."
"To reduce such evictions, one of the court's judges, Deborah Henderson; Shelby County Commissioner Erika Sugarmon; and Cindy Ettingoff, then-CEO of Memphis Area Legal Services, last summer secured $240,000 in the county budget to pilot a pre-litigation mediation program for landlord-tenant disputes.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,"judge, General Sessions Civil Court",null
"The cash didn't make it to MALS until February 2024, due to problems with how the County Commission resolution was originally drafted, Henderson said.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,"judge, General Sessions Civil Court",null
"Recently, MALS worked with a woman who was living in a house that 'should not be lived in by anyone' and was starting to fall behind on rent, Henderson said. It seemed like a case headed toward an eviction for the tenant, a code violation for the landlord or both. But with MALS' help, the landlord is making repairs, and the tenant is using some leftover rental assistance funds to catch up on rent.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,"judge, General Sessions Civil Court",null
"'There are no income limits or income requirements,' Henderson told a WLOK-AM audience earlier this summer. 'If you're a tenant who is having trouble with your landlord, you need to give us a call. … If you're a landlord and you have a troublesome tenant … give us a call.'",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,"judge, General Sessions Civil Court",null
"Nicole Grida, the new MALS CEO, said her team has started creating marketing materials for the program, building partnerships with local nonprofits and screening folks who call in for other services to see if they will fit the program's criteria, which has resulted in many promising leads.",Named Person,Nicole Grida,"CEO, Memphis Area Legal Services",null
"For the program to succeed, Grida said raising greater awareness will be key, as most Memphians it could help don't yet know it exists.",Named Person,Nicole Grida,"CEO, Memphis Area Legal Services",null
"Woods' case, for instance, sounded like a perfect fit for mediation, Henderson said, if only they'd found him before the eviction was filed. 'We could have drafted a document that ensured the landlord (followed the verbal agreement),' she said.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,"judge, General Sessions Civil Court",null
"Meanwhile, Grida said MALS is looking for other funders interested in backing the effort.",Named Person,Nicole Grida,"CEO, Memphis Area Legal Services",null
"Henderson believes the program will require a much longer pilot period before it's able to produce the proof necessary to create a housing court. But, despite the rough start, she remains 'very hopeful' for its future.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,"judge, General Sessions Civil Court",null
