"In a sparsely populated room at the Hickory Hill Community Center in mid-April, Judge Deborah Henderson was quite candid with the renters gathered to learn about the eviction process. House Bill 2267, which cut tenants' right to a continuance in half, hadn't yet been signed by Gov. Bill Lee. If the governor signed it, Henderson said, it would have ""devastating"" consequences for renters. To Henderson, who judges thousands of eviction cases per year, the only explanation for such action was landlord lobbying.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,Judge,who judges thousands of eviction cases per year

"In the statement, Swann said the bill will help landlords free up apartments more quickly for the thousands of Tennesseeans seeking a home. He also said it would help the apartment industry develop new apartments, but he didn't make clear how it would.",Named Person,Art Swann,Sen.

"This session, Thompson thought he had a shot at amending state law to let Memphis join its peer in Middle Tennessee — until he realized the Tennessee Association of Realtors was dead set against him, no matter what compromises he offered them. ""(TAR) has the connection with a lot of legislators, especially on the commerce committee, where this was going to be,"" Thompson said. ""(And) they were just ironclad.""",Named Person,Dwayne Thompson,Rep. Dwayne Thompson (D-Cordova),

"""How are you going to find the (bad actors)? It looks to me like the good people will do it but the bad people aren't going to change,"" Marsh said during the subcommittee hearing.",Named Person,Pat Marsh,Rep. Pat Marsh (R-Shelbyville),
"Given TAR's opposition and the legislature itself having recently moved ""much farther to the right,"" in his experience, Thompson said a Shelby County rental registry is ""probably not in the cards, for several years anyway."" Though he's not running for reelection, he's hopeful whoever succeeds him will be able to find other ways to help cities deal with slumlords.",Named Person,Dwayne Thompson,Rep. Dwayne Thompson (D-Cordova),
"While most landlords do this already, Thompson said he's heard from tenants who tell him they have no way of contacting their landlord or property manager about maintenance issues.",Named Person,Dwayne Thompson,Rep. Dwayne Thompson (D-Cordova),
"Still, Rees sees the legislation's passage as a win. Because even if landlords aren't responsive, it will provide tenants with proof they're requesting maintenance through the proper channels — proof lawyers like Rees could theoretically use in their defense. ""I really am happy to see that pass,"" Rees said. ""I think it's important that tenants do have good quality contact information for their property manager or owner.""",Named Person,Brian Rees,staff attorney at The Works Inc. nonprofit,who has represented hundreds of tenants in eviction proceedings in recent years
