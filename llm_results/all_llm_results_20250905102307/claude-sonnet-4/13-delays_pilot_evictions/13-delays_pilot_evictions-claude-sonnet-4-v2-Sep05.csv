"About nine months ago, the two men agreed he could withhold rent until repairs were made, he said.",Named Person,Bryant Woods,null,"One day last fall, Bryant Woods' rotted-out flooring opened up beneath his 11-year-old daughter. Major leaks in the rental home had allowed mold to thrive and rot to set in. In the winters, he was forced to use space heaters or his electric oven to stay warm since the heat didn't work."
"To reduce such evictions, one of the court's judges, Deborah Henderson; Shelby County Commissioner Erika Sugarmon; and Cindy Ettingoff, then-CEO of Memphis Area Legal Services, last summer secured $240,000 in the county budget to pilot a pre-litigation mediation program for landlord-tenant disputes.",Document,null,null,null
"The cash didn't make it to MALS until February 2024, due to problems with how the County Commission resolution was originally drafted, Henderson said.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,judge,one of the court's judges
"Recently, MALS worked with a woman who was living in a house that ""should not be lived in by anyone"" and was starting to fall behind on rent, Henderson said. It seemed like a case headed toward an eviction for the tenant, a code violation for the landlord or both. But with MALS' help, the landlord is making repairs, and the tenant is using some leftover rental assistance funds to catch up on rent.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,judge,one of the court's judges
Though the program has only helped a couple of tenants so far — not 300 — Henderson believes it's already proving its value.,Named Person,Deborah Henderson,judge,one of the court's judges

"Woods' case, for instance, sounded like a perfect fit for mediation, Henderson said, if only they'd found him before the eviction was filed.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,judge,one of the court's judges
"""We could have drafted a document that ensured the landlord (followed the verbal agreement),"" she said.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,judge,one of the court's judges
"Meanwhile, Grida said MALS is looking for other funders interested in backing the effort.",Named Person,Nicole Grida,"CEO, MALS",the new MALS CEO
