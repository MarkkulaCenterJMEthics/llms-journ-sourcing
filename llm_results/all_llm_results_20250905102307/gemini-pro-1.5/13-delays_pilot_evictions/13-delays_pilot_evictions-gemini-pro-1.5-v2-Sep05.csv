"But receiving the money from the county turned into an adventure. The cash didn’t make it to MALS until February 2024, due to problems with how the County Commission resolution was originally drafted, Henderson said.

Ultimately, MALS wasn’t able to launch the program in earnest until June.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,Judge,one of the court’s judges

But with MALS’ help, the landlord is making repairs, and the tenant is using some leftover rental assistance funds to catch up on rent.",Named Person,Deborah Henderson,Judge,one of the court’s judges
