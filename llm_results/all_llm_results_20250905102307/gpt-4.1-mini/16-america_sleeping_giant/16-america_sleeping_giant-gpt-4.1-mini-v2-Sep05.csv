"""In 2024, the election is going to be about mobilization,” Lake told reporters. “There is no question that the biggest contest between the two parties is going to be who can get their voters out to vote. Democrats have an enthusiasm gap today, and the progressive alliance and Democrats have fissures within their constituency that makes getting out the vote even more important. The biggest bloc of potential voters by far is low-income, low-wage voters. Increased participation even by miniscule percentages could be game changers. It is a massive voter engagement that is being started here today.”",Named Person,Celinda Lake,President of Lake Research Partners,"respected pollster Celinda Lake, President of Lake Research Partners"

"“For far too long extremists have blamed poor people and low wage people for their plight while moderates too often have ignored poor people, appealing instead to the so-called middle class while the poor and low wage people have become nearly half of this country,” Barber told reporters. “Poor and low wage people have the power to determine and decide the 2024 elections and elections beyond. In the 2016 election there were 34 million poor and low wealth people eligible to vote but didn’t. These voters made up more than a quarter of the electorate.”",Named Person,William Barber,Rev.

"Barber continued: “Poverty is now the fourth leading crisis of death in America, a moral crisis in America taking the lives of 800 people a day and this is before and after COVID…These are the issues that must be at the center of the narrative of a democracy in our country. If we are serious about saving the democracy it can’t be some philosophical term. Saving the democracy must be a Third Reconstruction where people are paid a living wage—where people have health care—where public education is fully funded and where voting rights are protected and expanded.”",Named Person,William Barber,Rev. Dr.,under the leadership of Barber and Rev. Dr. Liz Theoharis
"Barber called out by name eight moderate U.S. Senate Democrats that in 2021 joined with the Republicans to defeat raising the minimum wage to $1 from the $7.25 where it has been stuck since 2009 when Obama was president. Speakers at the press conference referenced Congress’s decision to roll back the expansion of the Earned Income Child Tax Credit, which caused a major spike in childhood poverty and the Biden administration’s decision to let states “unwind” Medicaid when the White House declared the pandemic was over.
