"A senior at North Country Union High School in Newport, Wilburn, 17, recalls being in line for the bathroom when the girl in front turned around and reached for her hair. Despite telling her not to touch it, Wilburn said the girl 'grabbed' her hair. 'She then told me that I felt like a sheep and she imitated the noises of one,' said Wilburn, a leader with the Vermont Student Anti-Racism Network. Once, when she was wearing a head covering because she was in the midst of braiding her hair, Wilburn said a student pulled it off and ran away in the school hall. When she wore a headwrap another time, students said she looked like Marge Simpson and that she looked too African for their comfort. 'Later in the day, someone took it off me,' she said. 'I wouldn't be scared of going out with a bonnet or a head wrap if this bill was in place at the time of these incidents,' she said in an email.",Named Person Sources,Aaliyah Wilburn,,A senior at North Country Union High School in Newport; a leader with the Vermont Student Anti-Racism Network

"For her daughter, she said, it first occurred in pre-school. While picking up her daughter one afternoon she said she was dismayed to find her wearing a stop sign on her chest that read, 'Please ask to touch my hair.' A teacher explained that her daughter was reacting to several instances of students touching and petting her hair without her consent, LaMont continued. 'So it was in fact my 4-year-old's idea to make a sign as a signal to her peers to stop violating her body and personal space,' she said. In another incident, her daughter's dance teacher asked to have her recently installed braids taken out so the child's hair could be put up in a bun to look like the majority of the other white kids in the class.",Named Person Sources,Saudia LaMont,Representative,D-Morristown

"Rep. Mike Mrowicki, D-Putney, another bill sponsor, said he has heard from constituents who have faced discrimination due to their hair. With the population and demographic of Vermont fast changing, this bill is a common sense effort to make sure that residents are not ostracized or mistreated because of who they are, he said. 'The reality that people of color are often ostracized or mistreated because of their hair. It can be as seemingly innocent as people wanting to touch it — which is really an invasion of people's space,' he said.",Named Person Sources,Mike Mrowicki,Representative,D-Putney; another bill sponsor
