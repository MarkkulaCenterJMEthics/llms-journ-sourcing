It is not enough for Oakland Unified School District to do an internal investigation because we need to know what has happened.”",Named Person Sources,Stuart Loebl,sixth-grade science teacher,at Frick

"Director Valarie Bachelor, the chair of OUSD’s facilities committee, said lead abatement will continue to be a topic at every facilities meeting until the issue is resolved. “This is not new to Oakland, but it is something that we need to tackle as an entire city, and we need to have community partners, philanthropic partners, as well as our county and state folks to support us in dealing with this issue,” she said. “As we talk about budget adjustments and what we need to be funding … I will be pushing to make sure that we have a robust deferred maintenance budget so that we don’t have these issues, and so that we can tackle these issues as they happen, versus when tragedies like this occur.”",Named Person Sources,Valarie Bachelor,Director;the chair of OUSD’s facilities committee,
