"How can our schools be a safe place and support students in our district if we can’t even keep our water clean? When I hear that something as major as lead contamination reports getting lost in the system or not being communicated to the appropriate school or staff, it is absolutely horrifying and heartbreaking.",Named Person Sources,Max Simmons,Student Director,one of OUSD’s student directors
"I sincerely apologize for the stress and concern this has caused our school sites, students and families. We understand the gravity of this situation and we are fully committed to taking immediate, transparent and corrective action",Named Person Sources,Kyla Johnson-Trammell,Superintendent,
"There is so much trust rebuilding that has to be done for our community. We have failed. And when I say ‘we’ I mean OUSD has failed at its most basic job of not poisoning our students. To start, we need an independent audit. It is not enough for Oakland Unified School District to do an internal investigation because we need to know what has happened.",Named Person Sources,Stuart Loebl,sixth-grade science teacher,a sixth-grade science teacher at Frick
"Why didn’t you do your job? You knew months ago that the water was contaminated. You didn’t act, and you let those kids come back to school and drink poisoned water. Now who is going to cover our medical bills? I demand you test all the kids in the district. I want to find out which kids are sick with lead poisoning!",Named Person Sources,Marina Muñoz,,a parent at Madison Park Academy and an organizer with Communities for a Better Environment
"This is not new to Oakland, but it is something that we need to tackle as an entire city, and we need to have community partners, philanthropic partners, as well as our county and state folks to support us in dealing with this issue. As we talk about budget adjustments and what we need to be funding … I will be pushing to make sure that we have a robust deferred maintenance budget so that we don’t have these issues, and so that we can tackle these issues as they happen, versus when tragedies like this occur.",Named Person Sources,Valarie Bachelor,Director; the chair of OUSD’s facilities committee,
