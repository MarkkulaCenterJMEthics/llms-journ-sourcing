**Note:** Since there were no direct quotes or statements from Named Organization sources, Unnamed Group of People sources, or Anonymous Sources, those sections are mostly empty. If you'd like me to clarify or expand on any of these points, please let me know!

Upon re-reading the instructions, I realized that I could improve the output for the "Unnamed Group of People" and "Named Organization Sources" sections. Here's an updated version:
