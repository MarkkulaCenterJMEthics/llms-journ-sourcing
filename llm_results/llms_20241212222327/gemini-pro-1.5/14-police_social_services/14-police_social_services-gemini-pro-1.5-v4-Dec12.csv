"A study by the Vermont nonprofit Crime Research Group shows Brattleboro police are dispatched most to the local Quality Inn, where the state is housing people otherwise without shelter (authorities received 181 calls there in the first half of this year), as well as to such downtown locations as the Whetstone path park (112 calls so far in 2024), the Groundworks Collaborative shelter (93) and Transportation Center parking garage (57).",Named Organization Sources,Vermont nonprofit Crime Research Group,,
"Groundworks Collaborative, for example, helps local people without permanent housing (its outreach team reports contact with 159 such individuals so far this year).",Named Organization Sources,Groundworks Collaborative,,
"But the nonprofit had to strengthen its rules against threatening behavior after the 2023 killing of its shelter coordinator, allegedly by a client who is now in prison and awaiting trial on charges of first-degree murder.",Named Organization Sources,Groundworks Collaborative,,

"“Jaws dropped,” Jim Baker, a consultant for a state public safety enhancement initiative, recounted at a recent public meeting. “The providers recognized those folks and came to the realization that if they’re falling through the cracks in their system, who ends up dealing with them?”",Named Person Sources,Jim Baker,consultant for a state public safety enhancement initiative,

"“The 20 people that are consuming a lot of resources clearly need some, but they’re not getting the right ones,” Brattleboro Assistant Police Chief Jeremy Evans recently told the town selectboard. “We’re trying to get everything we have out to the service providers so that they can use that data to inform their decision-making.”",Named Person Sources,Jeremy Evans,Brattleboro Assistant Police Chief,
"“The disorder we are witnessing, especially in our downtown area, has many causes and impacts,” Evans wrote the selectboard in a recent memorandum. “Not all of these are criminal in nature.”",Named Person Sources,Jeremy Evans,Brattleboro Assistant Police Chief,
"In the case of people receiving no-trespass notices, offenders are barred from locations if their actions “significantly disrupt the ability to provide services,” the assistant police chief said in an interview.",Named Person Sources,Jeremy Evans,assistant police chief,
"“You have a lot of people looking for help,” Evans said, “but there’s a small percentage that, for whatever reason, are unable or unwilling to accept it.”",Named Person Sources,Jeremy Evans,assistant police chief,

"“We were looking at real information that made us have some quite difficult conversations,” Quipp said following the session. “Here’s the name of this person who has trespassed at this place, this place, this place, this place, this place and we know that they need these kinds of services.
