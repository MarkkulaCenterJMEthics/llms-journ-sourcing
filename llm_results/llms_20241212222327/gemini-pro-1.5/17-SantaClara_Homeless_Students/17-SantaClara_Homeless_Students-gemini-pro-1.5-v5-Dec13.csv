"Annya Artigas, the director of Social Emotional Learning at the Alum Rock district, said homelessness can affect students inside and outside the classroom.

"Some homeless students may also miss class or arrive late because they live in temporary shelters outside of the district. In order to get to school, they use public transportation to travel across town. “There are a number of kids that we knew who were homeless who would show up late. Before we brought them to the classroom, we bring them to the cafeteria and grab them something to eat and grab them some milk so that they can have something in their stomach before they went into the classroom,” she said.",Named Person Sources,Annya Artigas,director of Social Emotional Learning at the Alum Rock district,
"As a result of these different stressors, homeless children may also struggle to stay mentally present in school, Artigas said.

And all of those things are impacting their ability to engage, their ability to receive information and process it and retain it,” Artigas said.",Named Person Sources,Annya Artigas,director of Social Emotional Learning at the Alum Rock district,
