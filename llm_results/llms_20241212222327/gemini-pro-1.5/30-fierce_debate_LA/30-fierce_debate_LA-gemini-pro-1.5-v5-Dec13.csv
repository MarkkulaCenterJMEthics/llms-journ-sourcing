"Daniel Yukelson with the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles pointed to recent data from the National Apartment Association, a trade group for property owners, concluding that California landlords earn 7 cents of profit on average for every dollar of rent.",Named Person Sources,Daniel Yukelson,,with the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles
"“What [the report] is trying to do is make a PR effort to lay the groundwork to chip away at what little ability landlords have in L.A. to be able to raise rents and be able to keep up with their costs,” Yukelson said.",Named Person Sources,Daniel Yukelson,,
"He said the report takes a macroeconomic view of the city’s rental market, but fails to capture the unique struggles facing many small landlords.",Named Person Sources,Daniel Yukelson,,
"“There are plenty of owners out there who have had their renters in place for many years,” Yukelson said. “They're way below market. And they're having trouble today keeping up with the growing costs of insurance, maintenance and supplies.”",Named Person Sources,Daniel Yukelson,,
"“Small landlords are able to maintain their profits and draw income above their expenses — they haven't been overly burdened by rent stabilization,” said Christina Boyar, a legal fellow with Public Counsel and a member of the Keep L.A. Housed coalition.",Named Person Sources,Christina Boyar,legal fellow,with Public Counsel and a member of the Keep L.A. Housed coalition
"“The report shows that rent costs exceeding what tenants can pay is a primary cause of homelessness,” Boyar said. “We are obviously in a homelessness crisis in L.A., and if this formula isn't updated soon, more folks will just fall into homelessness.”",Named Person Sources,Christina Boyar,,
"Daniel Flaming, president of the Economic Roundtable and a co-author of the report, said he didn’t have a good answer for why the report was kept under wraps.",Named Person Sources,Daniel Flaming,president,of the Economic Roundtable and a co-author of the report
"“I think when it's a politically contentious issue, there are attempts to manage the conversation,” Flaming said. “The substance of the report is final. It was submitted as a final report and accepted by the city as a final work product.”",Named Person Sources,Daniel Flaming,,
"Sharon Sandow, a spokesperson for the L.A. Housing Department, told LAist last week the document was still a “draft report,” and they didn't have a specific date lined up for its release.",Named Person Sources,Sharon Sandow,spokesperson,for the L.A. Housing Department
"“There are several rounds of revisions left to go before this report is considered final,” Sandow said in an email. “Economic Roundtable is under contract to complete this report through January 2025 — though clearly we hope to have it finalized before then.”",Named Person Sources,Sharon Sandow,,
"By the end of last week, Sandow sent LAist a version of the report she described as ""final.""",Named Person Sources,Sharon Sandow,,
"“The cost of electricity is just going to continue going up,” Yukelson with the Apartment Association said. If the city stops landlords who provide electricity from raising rents an additional 1% per year, he said, “The next tenant is going to have to pay that burden, because the rents are going to have to go up.”",Named Person Sources,Daniel Yukelson,,with the Apartment Association
"On balance, Flaming said the report shows that L.A.’s policies diverge significantly from how other California cities handle rent control. He said the utility surcharge in particular seems “arbitrary.”",Named Person Sources,Daniel Flaming,,
"“The Los Angeles ceiling and floor are atypically high for rent-controlled cities,” he said. “Among cities that have elected to control rents — and not all cities have — Los Angeles appears to be tilted toward landlords.”",Named Person Sources,Daniel Flaming,,
"Soto-Martinez, one of the council members who requested the report be commissioned — has already called for capping increases at 3%.",Named Person Sources,Hugo Soto-Martinez,council member,one of the council members who requested the report be commissioned
"In an email reacting to the Economic Roundtable report, Soto-Martínez told LAist, “As we await the finalized version of this report, it’s heartening to see so much data supporting the policy changes that renters have been demanding — especially when it comes to preventing excessive rent increases that can devastate working families.”",Named Person Sources,Hugo Soto-Martinez,,
"According to U.S. Census data, just over half of those renters spend 90% of their income or more on rent.",Document Sources,U.S. Census,,U.S. Census data
