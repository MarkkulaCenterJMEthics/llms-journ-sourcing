"The lab found, in general, that food and groceries are the top way participants are spending money, making up 35% of the funds spent. Retail sales and services are a close second at 31%.
Participants also spent the money on transportation (10%) and housing and utilities (8%). They spend a smaller percentage on educational expenses, miscellaneous expenses and health care or medical expenses.",Named Organization Sources,Stanford Guaranteed Income Lab,,"tracks 31 pilot programs throughout the country, including the Breathe pilot"
"For years, Kipp Kahlia felt stuck.",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,"The Long Beach guitarist used to tour the country with reggae artists. But 20 years ago, after contracting intestinal parasites on a trip abroad, Kahlia had to take a step back from gigging."
"Her health deteriorated and visits to doctors drained her savings. Recently she decided to start a business performing social justice songs at events. But with no extra funds or time, she had to pause the venture.",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,The Long Beach guitarist
"“With all the struggling I was doing, my attitude took a hit,” Kahlia said. “The more you witness yourself being down and out, the more you feel down and out, and the more stuck you feel.”",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
Now Kahlia is getting a chance to get unstuck.,Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,"Kahlia was selected as one of 1,000 participants in L.A. County’s guaranteed income program, called Breathe."
"The pilot program will allow researchers to track its impact in a large, diverse region, said Sean Kline, director of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, which studies guaranteed income programs across the country.",Named Person Sources,Sean Kline,director of the Stanford Basic Income Lab,which studies guaranteed income programs across the country
"“Whenever L.A. city or county or Chicago or New York do something bold like this, it’s a really important signal that this big policy idea found its footing during COVID and represents a possible way forward in terms of supporting low income people across America,” Kline said.",Named Person Sources,Sean Kline,,
"One question the Breathe program raises, Kline said, is what does it mean to have extra money for months versus several years?",Named Person Sources,Sean Kline,,
"“If you knew the money was coming for three years, it’s a much longer runway. Can you go back to school? Can you quit your job now and look for a new one? Can you care for your aging parents?”",Named Person Sources,Sean Kline,,
"Every six months, program participants and members in the control group receive the same survey questions about their wellbeing, financially and mentally, said Amy Castro, director of Penn’s Center for Guaranteed Income Research.",Named Person Sources,Amy Castro,director of Penn’s Center for Guaranteed Income Research,
"“There is so much we don’t know yet,” Castro said. “We don’t know how long people need to receive cash to create what level of change.”",Named Person Sources,Amy Castro,,
"More than halfway through the Breathe program, Kahlia said she and her business remain a work in progress, but the funds have given her an ability to move forward in a way she hadn’t before.",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
"“It’s taking me from always putting out fires to being able to actually make some moves to advance, not just being stuck,” Kahlia said.",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
"“I didn’t expect to be accepted,” to the Breathe program, Kahlia said. “When I was, I was really, really pleasantly surprised. It definitely took the edge off.”",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
"She figured $1,000 a month for three years would be enough to start investing in her business. She performed in a few experimental shows in 2017 when she sang about social justice issues and got positive responses from audiences.",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
Singing about social justice allows Kahlia to be a performer again and return to her roots as a reggae artist. She promised herself she would make this business work and focus on her health.,Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
"Kahlia said she doesn’t keep track of how she spends the Breathe money. A lot of it has gone to health expenses, and some has gone to her business. But she also spends it on day-to-day things like groceries, or a taco night out with friends, she said.",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
"Kahlia thought if she was going to meet clients for her business, showing up in an old, dinged up car wouldn’t do a lot for her image.",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
"“I’m probably getting more comfortable with spending money,” she said. “Just learning to say yes to stuff. There’s some stuff that, at the beginning of the program I felt was, you know, almost extravagant. And now I’m like ‘Oh my god, I really needed that for my business to move forward.’”",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
"There’s also anecdotal evidence that participants are spending some on things that may help them build wealth, like starting a business or saving for a down payment on a home, said Brian Arredondo, a coach for program participants.",Named Person Sources,Brian Arredondo,a coach for program participants,
"Arredondo regularly checks in with about 300 participants. He said participants come to him with a huge variety of needs, from questions about investing and money management to how to find a good mechanic.",Named Person Sources,Brian Arredondo,,
"He assists them in applying for state programs, such as CalFresh, and helps some enroll in schools or colleges. He even has helped families sign their kids up on sports teams with the extra funds.",Named Person Sources,Brian Arredondo,,
"“People need help with normal, everyday interactions that may be easy for some individuals,” he said. “But for others, they don’t have any prior experience with them.”",Named Person Sources,Brian Arredondo,,
"It’s those hard-to-measure impacts that are key, said Ely Fournier, who oversees the program coaches at Strength Based Community Change.",Named Person Sources,Ely Fournier,,who oversees the program coaches at Strength Based Community Change
"“It can’t just be the money,” Fournier said. “It’s the opportunity and the access to experiences sometimes that really make a big difference when there is even a little bit more resources folks can have. ”",Named Person Sources,Ely Fournier,,
Now Kahlia is taking a step back from teaching and spending time writing new arrangements of music to perform for clients. She’s working on updating her website and making calls to potential clients.,Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
"“I haven’t gotten to the sexy part yet,” Kahlia said. “I had to get stronger and healthier, clear space, and lay a foundation first. Pulling yourself out of a hole often doesn’t look dramatic. For me it’s been the ability to do some fairly tedious stuff over an extended period of time, over and over again.”",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,,
