"""With all the struggling I was doing, my attitude took a hit,"" Kahlia said. ""The more you witness yourself being down and out, the more you feel down and out, and the more stuck you feel.""",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,null,"The Long Beach guitarist used to tour the country with reggae artists. But 20 years ago, after contracting intestinal parasites on a trip abroad, Kahlia had to take a step back from gigging. Her health deteriorated and visits to doctors drained her savings. Recently she decided to start a business performing social justice songs at events. But with no extra funds or time, she had to pause the venture."
"""It’s taking me from always putting out fires to being able to actually make some moves to advance, not just being stuck,"" Kahlia said.",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,null,"More than halfway through the Breathe program, Kahlia said she and her business remain a work in progress, but the funds have given her an ability to move forward in a way she hadn’t before."
"""I didn’t expect to be accepted,"" to the Breathe program, Kahlia said. ""When I was, I was really, really pleasantly surprised. It definitely took the edge off.""",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,null,"The money came at the perfect time. Because of the pandemic, Kahlia had stopped teaching guitar lessons in person at parks and recreation centers and transitioned to virtual teaching. But one by one, her clients dropped off."
"""I’m probably getting more comfortable with spending money,"" she said. ""Just learning to say yes to stuff. There’s some stuff that, at the beginning of the program I felt was, you know, almost extravagant. And now I’m like ‘Oh my god, I really needed that for my business to move forward.’""",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,null,"Kahlia said she doesn’t keep track of how she spends the Breathe money. A lot of it has gone to health expenses, and some has gone to her business. But she also spends it on day-to-day things like groceries, or a taco night out with friends, she said."
"""I haven’t gotten to the sexy part yet,"" Kahlia said. ""I had to get stronger and healthier, clear space, and lay a foundation first. Pulling yourself out of a hole often doesn’t look dramatic. For me it’s been the ability to do some fairly tedious stuff over an extended period of time, over and over again.""",Named Person Sources,Kipp Kahlia,null,"A year and a half into the program, Kahlia’s business isn’t off the ground yet. But she’s made some progress. The program funds have given her time, she said. Normally she’d be stuck in a cycle of teaching guitar lessons to make money, but wouldn’t have time for her business."
"""Whenever L.A. city or county or Chicago or New York do something bold like this, it’s a really important signal that this big policy idea found its footing during COVID and represents a possible way forward in terms of supporting low income people across America,"" Kline said.",Named Person Sources,Sean Kline,Director of the Stanford Basic Income Lab,"The pilot program will allow researchers to track its impact in a large, diverse region, said Sean Kline, director of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, which studies guaranteed income programs across the country."
"""If you knew the money was coming for three years, it’s a much longer runway. Can you go back to school? Can you quit your job now and look for a new one? Can you care for your aging parents?""",Named Person Sources,Sean Kline,Director of the Stanford Basic Income Lab,"One question the Breathe program raises, Kline said, is what does it mean to have extra money for months versus several years?"
"""There is so much we don’t know yet,"" Castro said. ""We don’t know how long people need to receive cash to create what level of change.""",Named Person Sources,Amy Castro,Director of Penn’s Center for Guaranteed Income Research,"Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are surveying the 1,000 Breathe participants, along with a control group of people not receiving funds. Every six months, program participants and members in the control group receive the same survey questions about their wellbeing, financially and mentally, said Amy Castro, director of Penn’s Center for Guaranteed Income Research."
"""People need help with normal, everyday interactions that may be easy for some individuals,"" he said. ""But for others, they don’t have any prior experience with them.""",Named Person Sources,Brian Arredondo,Coach for program participants,"The program’s coaches, provided through Wilmington-based Strength Based Community Change, personally support participants as their lives change. Arredondo regularly checks in with about 300 participants. He said participants come to him with a huge variety of needs, from questions about investing and money management to how to find a good mechanic."
"""It can’t just be the money,"" Fournier said. ""It’s the opportunity and the access to experiences sometimes that really make a big difference when there is even a little bit more resources folks can have. """,Named Person Sources,Ely Fournier,Oversees the program coaches at Strength Based Community Change,"Researchers and advocates stress how no-strings-attached cash not only improves peoples’ financial situations, but gives them peace of mind and improves mental health. Participants report feeling more free to spend money on self care, outings with family members or sharing their wealth with community members. It’s those hard-to-measure impacts that are key, said Ely Fournier, who oversees the program coaches at Strength Based Community Change."
