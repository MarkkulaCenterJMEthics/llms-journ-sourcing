      "Title of Source": "null",
      "Source Justification": "The Long Beach guitarist used to tour the country with reggae artists. But 20 years ago, after contracting intestinal parasites on a trip abroad, Kahlia had to take a step back from gigging. Her health deteriorated and visits to doctors drained her savings. Recently she decided to start a business performing social justice songs at events. But with no extra funds or time, she had to pause the venture."

      "Sourced Statement": "\"It’s taking me from always putting out fires to being able to actually make some moves to advance, not just being stuck,\" Kahlia said.",

      "Title of Source": "null",
      "Source Justification": "The money came at the perfect time. Because of the pandemic, Kahlia had stopped teaching guitar lessons in person at parks and recreation centers and transitioned to virtual teaching. But one by one, her clients dropped off."

      "Sourced Statement": "\"I’m probably getting more comfortable with spending money,\" she said. \"Just learning to say yes to stuff. There’s some stuff that, at the beginning of the program I felt was, you know, almost extravagant. And now I’m like ‘Oh my god, I really needed that for my business to move forward.’\"",

      "Type of Source": "Named Person",
      "Title of Source": "null",
      "Source Justification": "Kahlia said she doesn’t keep track of how she spends the Breathe money. A lot of it has gone to health expenses, and some has gone to her business. But she also spends it on day-to-day things like groceries, or a taco night out with friends, she said."

    {
      "Sourced Statement": "\"I haven’t gotten to the sexy part yet,\" Kahlia said. \"I had to get stronger and healthier, clear space, and lay a foundation first. Pulling yourself out of a hole often doesn’t look dramatic. For me it’s been the ability to do some fairly tedious stuff over an extended period of time, over and over again.\"",

      "Title of Source": "null",
      "Source Justification": "A year and a half into the program, Kahlia’s business isn’t off the ground yet. But she’s made some progress. The program funds have given her time, she said. Normally she’d be stuck in a cycle of teaching guitar lessons to make money, but wouldn’t have time for her business."

      "Type of Source": "Named Person",
      "Title of Source": "Director of the Stanford Basic Income Lab",

      "Title of Source": "Oversees the program coaches at Strength Based Community Change",
      "Source Justification": "Researchers and advocates stress how no-strings-attached cash not only improves peoples’ financial situations, but gives them peace of mind and improves mental health. Participants report feeling more free to spend money on self care, outings with family members or sharing their wealth with community members. It’s those hard-to-measure impacts that are key, said Ely Fournier, who oversees the program coaches at Strength Based Community Change."
