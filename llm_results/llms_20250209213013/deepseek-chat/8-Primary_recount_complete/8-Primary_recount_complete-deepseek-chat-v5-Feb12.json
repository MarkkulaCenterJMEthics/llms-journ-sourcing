      "Sourced Statement": "“This recount reaffirmed what we already knew from the June 18th primary. It really is amazing what we can achieve when we work as a team. It is an honor to be the VA 05 Republican nominee. I want to thank God and extend my sincere thanks to my family, to everyone who helped out on this campaign, to the people who endorsed and supported me, and to Donald J. Trump. Folks in the 5th District can rest assured that should they elect me in November, they will have an effective fighter in Congress who will get the job done. I look forward to working with Trump to defeat Kamala Harris and to helping elect Hung Cao in November. Now is the time to set our differences aside and unite as a party. Together we will Make America Great Again!”",
