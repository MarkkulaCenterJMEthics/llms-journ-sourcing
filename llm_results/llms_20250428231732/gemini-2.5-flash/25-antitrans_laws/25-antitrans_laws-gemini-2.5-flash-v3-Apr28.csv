"“There is a chilling effect,” said Lauren Kunis, CEO and executive director of VoteRiders, which helps voters obtain identification.",Named Person Sources,,,
"“There is an unsafe and intimidating environment around existing as trans in society, and definitely in being able to go to the polls safely and cast a ballot.”",Named Person Sources,,,
"“A lot is falling on poll workers to correctly enforce the law,” Kunis added.",Named Person Sources,,,
“And I would argue that is less of a solid protection in states where anti-trans rhetoric is skyrocketing.”,Named Person Sources,,,
"“Trans votes count,” said Ankit Rastogi, director of research for the National Center for Transgender Equality, which conducted the survey and will soon be known as Advocates for Trans Equality Education Fund.",Named Person Sources,,,

"Forcing a person to show identification that does not align with their gender identity could out them to people in their community, as Lucas Cameron-Vaughn, an attorney for the ACLU of Tennessee, explained.",Named Person Sources,,,
"“Trans people, just like everyone else, want to be able to travel, start new jobs, open bank accounts, enroll in school, vote — all of those things require some form of ID.",Named Person Sources,,,
"And so when a state goes out of its way to enforce its message about its belief about sex and gender on a license, and transgender people then have to publicize that when they show other people, it creates a dangerous environment,” he said.",Named Person Sources,,,
"“It’s a tactic that’s designed to splinter support for trans rights and suggest sort of who is harmed by protecting trans people — to frame that as cisgender women being the people harmed by protections for trans people,” said Rose Saxe, who is deputy project director for the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project.",Named Person Sources,,,
"“The states with the anti-trans laws are also the ones that are more likely to be passing anti-voter laws, full stop,” Kunis said.",Named Person Sources,,,

“And really to scare trans folks from even participating and getting the license if they needed to update it.”,Named Person Sources,,,
"“With these laws in Florida, you’re forced to choose between living authentically and just not really participating in public life,” Diaz said.",Named Person Sources,,,
"Diaz, who is transgender, moved to Florida from Massachusetts, where they had an “X” gender marker on their driver’s license.",Named Person Sources,,,
"Because they didn’t have all the necessary documentation and weren’t established yet with a local provider when they transferred their license to Florida, they forfeited that marker and defaulted to a license with their sex assigned at birth.",Named Person Sources,,,
"Diaz said they didn’t have any problems voting in person in the 2022 midterms, but they plan to vote by mail this November.",Named Person Sources,,,
"“I can imagine that a lot of trans folks in Florida who might not have access … to an accurate and affirming ID might not want to engage in that process at all, especially in such a heightened political environment,” Diaz said.",Named Person Sources,,,
"“Gender nonconforming people are already under such public scrutiny nationwide,” Diaz said.",Named Person Sources,,,
“That’s when you’re gonna see the convergence of those two elements.,Named Person Sources,,,
"It really seems like it would only result in more discrimination, more discomfort for trans people, more interrogation and potentially just being turned away.”",Named Person Sources,,,
"Hazel Krebs, a 42-year-old transgender woman living in Kansas, one of the states with a new anti-trans law, felt the weight of that increased scrutiny as she cast her ballot in March.",Named Person Sources,,,
