"To reduce such evictions, one of the court’s judges, Deborah Henderson; Shelby County Commissioner Erika Sugarmon; and Cindy Ettingoff, then-CEO of Memphis Area Legal Services, last summer secured $240,000 in the county budget to pilot a pre-litigation mediation program for landlord-tenant disputes.",Named Organization Sources,Memphis Area Legal Services,,
The initial goal was for MALS to use the money to hire a few employees — including a former code inspector since property conditions almost always drive the disputes.,Named Organization Sources,MALS,,
The nonprofit would then find tenants and landlords who seemed headed toward eviction and prevent at least 300 evictions — all in a year.,Named Organization Sources,MALS,,
"The cash didn’t make it to MALS until February 2024, due to problems with how the County Commission resolution was originally drafted, Henderson said.",Named Organization Sources,MALS,,
"By then, Ettingoff was no longer with MALS, and the interim executive director, Loyce Lambert Ryan, was dealing with the fallout of a major cyber attack.",Named Organization Sources,MALS,,
"Ultimately, MALS wasn’t able to launch the program in earnest until June.",Named Organization Sources,MALS,,

"Recently, MALS worked with a woman who was living in a house that “should not be lived in by anyone” and was starting to fall behind on rent, Henderson said.",Named Organization Sources,MALS,,
"But with MALS’ help, the landlord is making repairs, and the tenant is using some leftover rental assistance funds to catch up on rent.",Named Organization Sources,MALS,,
"To drum up more business, Henderson and MALS attorney Cedric Harris, who is leading the program, have been spending a few nights and weekends this summer speaking to churches, on radio shows and at other events.",Named Organization Sources,MALS,,
"Nicole Grida, the new MALS CEO, said her team has started creating marketing materials for the program, building partnerships with local nonprofits and screening folks who call in for other services to see if they will fit the program’s criteria, which has resulted in many promising leads.",Named Organization Sources,MALS,,
"Meanwhile, Grida said MALS is looking for other funders interested in backing the effort.",Named Organization Sources,MALS,,

"One day last fall, Bryant Woods’ rotted-out flooring opened up beneath his 11-year-old daughter.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
Major leaks in the rental home had allowed mold to thrive and rot to set in.,Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
"In the winters, he was forced to use space heaters or his electric oven to stay warm since the heat didn’t work.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
"About nine months ago, the two men agreed he could withhold rent until repairs were made, he said.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
"In the meantime, he started looking for a new place to live.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
"But, his landlord’s unwillingness to cooperate with rental history checks by property management firms made finding a new home for his family of five extremely difficult.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
"Then, recently, his landlord caught him by surprise and filed for eviction.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
"He couldn’t prove his missed rent payments were part of a verbal agreement, so the judge granted the property owner’s request and told Woods his family had 10 days to move.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
He left the courthouse without much hope.,Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,

But Henderson has been happy with the results since then.,Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
"Recently, MALS worked with a woman who was living in a house that “should not be lived in by anyone” and was starting to fall behind on rent, Henderson said.",Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
"It seemed like a case headed toward an eviction for the tenant, a code violation for the landlord or both.",Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
"But with MALS’ help, the landlord is making repairs, and the tenant is using some leftover rental assistance funds to catch up on rent.",Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
Though the program has only helped a couple of tenants so far — not 300 — Henderson believes it’s already proving its value.,Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
"To drum up more business, Henderson and MALS attorney Cedric Harris, who is leading the program, have been spending a few nights and weekends this summer speaking to churches, on radio shows and at other events.",Named Person Sources,Cedric Harris,,
"“There are no income limits or income requirements,” Henderson told a WLOK-AM audience earlier this summer.",Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
"“If you’re a tenant who is having trouble with your landlord, you need to give us a call.",Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,

"For the program to succeed, Grida said raising greater awareness will be key, as most Memphians it could help don’t yet know it exists.",Named Person Sources,Nicole Grida,,
"Woods’ case, for instance, sounded like a perfect fit for mediation, Henderson said, if only they’d found him before the eviction was filed.",Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
"“We could have drafted a document that ensured the landlord (followed the verbal agreement),” she said.",Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
"Instead, Woods was left with 10 days to find a new home.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
"Thankfully, he found something just in time — a three-bedroom townhouse in Whitehaven with an “undesirable” exterior but is “fairly nice” inside.",Named Person Sources,Bryant Woods,,
"Meanwhile, Grida said MALS is looking for other funders interested in backing the effort.",Named Person Sources,Nicole Grida,,
Henderson believes the program will require a much longer pilot period before it’s able to produce the proof necessary to create a housing court.,Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
"But, despite the rough start, she remains “very hopeful” for its future.",Named Person Sources,Deborah Henderson,,
