INSTRUCTIONS
Read the attached news article carefully. Follow ALL the steps below to extract the following data from the article. Sourced Statements, Name of Source, Type of Source, Title of Source, and Source Justification.
1. Using the definitions provided above, identify all the Anonymous Sources in the article. Remember that for Anonymous Sources, Name of Sources has a 'null' value. No need to write or print anything yet. 
2. For each Anonymous Source in your list above, find all the associated Sourcing Statements. For sourced statements, extract the exact full sentences from the article whether they are quotes or indirect speech as the data. Do not paraphrase or summarize quotes or indirect speech or the sentences themselves. Retain them as they are. Copy and paste the exact wording used in the article for each statement. And pay special attention to multiple statements from the same source. No need to write print anything yet. Remember that for Anonymous Sources, Name of Sources has a 'null' value. No need to write print anything yet. 
3. Now apply the definition of Source Justification given, and find the source justification for each anonymous source in each sourcing statement. Extract only the text that matches this definition directly from the story. Remember that source justification refers to words doing additional characterization or justification for inclusion of that source in the story. Do not synthesize or generate your words.  
Organize and print your data in JSON format as follows: 
{
  "Anonymous Sources": [ 
      "Sourced Statement": "string",
      "Name of Source": "string",
      "Type of Source": "string",
      "Source Justification": "string"
  ]
}
4. Apply the definition of the Type of Source "Unnamed Group of People" and find all such sources in the article. Remember that the type of source "Unnamed Group of People" is different from "Anonymous Source", so apply the definition carefully. No need to print or write anything for this step. 
5. For each source of the type "Unnamed Group of People" in your list above, find all the associated Sourcing Statements. Remember that none of the Sourced Statements in your Anonymous Sources list must appear on this list. And remember that for Unnamed Group of People, the Name of Source has a 'null' value. No need to print or write anything for this step. 
6. For each "Unnamed Group of People" source in each sourcing statement, find the Source Justification, by applying the definition given. 
Organize all your data and print in JSON format as follows: 
{
  "Unnamed Group of People": [ 
      "Sourced Statement": "string",
      "Name of Source": "string",
      "Type of Source": "string",
      "Source Justification": "string"
  ]
