1. Using the definitions provided above, identify all the Anonymous Sources in the article. Remember that for Anonymous Sources, Name of Source has a 'null' value. No need to write or print anything yet. 

2. For each Anonymous Source in your list above, find all the associated Sourced Statements. For sourced statements, extract the exact full sentences from the article whether they are quoted or indirect speech as the data. Do not paraphrase or summarize. Retain them as they are. Copy and paste the exact wording used in the article for each statement. And pay special attention to multiple statements from the same source. Also, sometimes the paragraph of text may have multiple sourced statements attributed to the same source. In this case, they are one instance of a sourced statement. Do not separate them out as multiple sourced statements. Sourced statements connected to the same source in new paragraphs are new instances. Remember that for Anonymous Sources, Name of Source has a 'null' value. No need to write print anything yet. 

3. Applying the definition of Title of Source provided above, for each Anonymous Source in your list, extract the Title, if present in the text. Remember that Anonymous Sources may or may not be included with a title, since the title itself may be sensitive information. But if a title is present, extract it. No need to print anything yet.

4. Now apply the definition of Source Justification given, and find the source justification for each anonymous source in each sourcing statement. Extract only the text that matches this definition directly from the story. Remember that source justification refers to words or sentences doing additional characterization or justification for inclusion of that source in the story. Do not synthesize or generate or summarize in your own words. Extract the actual text. If more than one source justification is present in the text, concatenate them as one single string separated by ';'.

5. Organize and add your data to a JSON object as follows: 

{
  "Anonymous Sources": [ 
      "Sourced Statement": "string",
      "Name of Source": "string",
      "Type of Source": "string",
      "Title of Source": "string",
      "Source Justification": "string"
  ]
}

6. Next, apply the definition of the Type of Source "Unnamed Group of People" and find all such sources in the article. Remember that the type of source "Unnamed Group of People" is different from "Anonymous Source", so apply the definition carefully. No need to print or write anything yet.

No need to print or write anything yet. 

9. For each "Unnamed Group of People" source in each sourcing statement, find the Source Justification, by applying the definition given. Extract only the text that matches this definition directly from the story. If the same Unnamed Group of People source is attributed into multiple sourcing statements, you may copy the Source Justification from the first sourced statement to the others for that source. Remember that source justification refers to words or sentences doing additional characterization or justification for inclusion of that source in the story. Do not synthesize or generate or summarize in your own words. Extract the actual text. If more than one source justification is present in the text, concatenate them as one single string separated by ';'.
